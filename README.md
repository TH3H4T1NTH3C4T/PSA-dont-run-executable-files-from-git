# Reason
Note: this isnt talking about releases in open source applications - even though compileing apps your self is recomended.

Dont run executable files found in repositorys espesialy if they where made unethical purposes. People normaly target script kiddies and infect there computer with malware.

# How to prevent
- **Always keep your operating system up to date** - Hackers take advantage of known vulnerabilitys which werent patched yet.
- **Get an antivirus** - Known exploits can oftentimes be detected by antiviruses and can prevent your system from being infected before you run them. A good free antivirus which is good for prevention is [Avast One](https://www.avast.com/en-us/avast-one), or you could pay for [MalwareBytes premium](https://www.malwarebytes.com/premium).
- **Check if the repo and repo owner is legit** - If the repo has obfuscated code or a lot of people are saying its unsafe then maybe dont use it...

# How to fix
I sugest you completely reinstall and reset your operating system. You can find out how here: [MacOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/erase-and-reinstall-macos-mh27903/mac), [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/reinstall-windows-d8369486-3e33-7d9c-dccc-859e2b022fc7). If youre on linux it depends on the distro you picked.

However, if the malware uses known exploits then get an antivirus such as [MalwareBytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) (its free).
