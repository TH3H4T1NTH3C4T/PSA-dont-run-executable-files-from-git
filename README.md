# Reason
Note: this isn't talking about releases in open-source applications - even though compiling apps your self is recommended.

Don't run executable files found in repositories especially if they were made for unethical purposes. People normally target script kiddies and infect their computers with malware.

# How to prevent
- **Always keep your operating system up to date** - Hackers take advantage of known vulnerabilities which weren't patched yet.
- **Get an antivirus** - Known exploits can oftentimes be detected by antiviruses and can prevent your system from being infected before you run them. A good free antivirus which is good for prevention is [Avast One](https://www.avast.com/en-us/avast-one), or you could pay for [MalwareBytes Premium](https://www.malwarebytes.com/premium).
- **Check if the repo and repo owner are legit** - If the repo has obfuscated code or a lot of people are saying it's unsafe then maybe don't use it... just a suggestion ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

# How to fix
I suggest you completely reinstall and reset your operating system. You can find out how here: [MacOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/erase-and-reinstall-macos-mh27903/mac), [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/reinstall-windows-d8369486-3e33-7d9c-dccc-859e2b022fc7). If you're on Linux it depends on the distro you picked.

However, if the malware uses known exploits then get an antivirus such as [MalwareBytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) (it's free).
